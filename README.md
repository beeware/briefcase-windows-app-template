A
[Cookiecutter <https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter/>](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter/)
template for building Python apps that will run under Windows, packaged
as an MSI installer.

## Using this template

The easiest way to use this project is to not use it at all - at least, not
directly.
[Briefcase <https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/>](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/)
is a tool that uses this template, rolling it out using data extracted from a
`pyproject.toml` configuration file.

However, if you *do* want use this template directly...

1. Install `cookiecutter`. This is a tool used to bootstrap complex project
   templates:

    > pip install cookiecutter

2. Run `cookiecutter` on the template::

    > cookiecutter
    > [https://github.com/beeware/briefcase-windows-app-template](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase-windows-app-template)

   This will ask you for a number of details of your application, including the
   `name` of your application (which should be a valid PyPI identifier), and
   the `Formal Name` of your application (the full name you use to describe
   your app). The remainder of these instructions will assume a `name` of
   `my-project`, and a formal name of `My Project`.

3. `Obtain a Python Windows Embeddable package`, and extract it into the
   `My Project/src` directory generated by the template. This will give you a
   `python3.dll` (amongst other artefacts) in the `My Project/src` folder.

4. Add your code to the template, into the `My Project/src/app` directory.
   At the very minimum, you need to have an `app/<app name>/__main__.py` file
   that defines an entry point that will start your application.

   If your code has any dependencies, they should be installed under the
   `My Project/src/app_packages` directory.

If you've done this correctly, a project with a formal name of `My Project`,
with an app name of `my-project` should have a directory structure that
looks something like:

```text
    My Project/
        src/
            app/
                my_project/
                    __init__.py
                    __main__.py
                    app.py
            app_packages/
                ...
        python3.dll
        ...
        briefcase.toml
        my-project.ico
        my-project.wxs
        MyProject.exe
```

This project can now be compiled with
[WiX <https://wixtoolset.org>](https://wixtoolset.org)
to produce an MSI file. Open a command prompt, and change into the `My Project`
directory. Then:

```text
    C:\...>wix build -ext WixToolset.UI.wixext -arch x64 my-project.wxs -loc unicode.wxl -o "My Project.msi"
```

The MSI file can then be used to install your application. When installed, your
application will have an entry in your Start menu.

## Next steps

Of course, running Python code isn't very interesting by itself - you won't
be able to do any console input or output, because a Windows app doesn't
display a console.

To do something interesting, you'll need to work with the native Windows system
libraries to draw widgets and respond to screen taps. The `Python for .NET`
bridging library can be used to interface with the Windows system libraries.
Alternatively, you could use a cross-platform widget toolkit that supports
Windows (such as `Toga`) to provide a GUI for your application.

If you have any external library dependencies (like Toga, or anything other
third-party library), you should install the library code into the
`app_packages` directory. This directory is the same as a  `site_packages`
directory on a desktop Python install.
